ffffffffffffffffs there a good way to go this? Or, maybe this isn't the way that git wants methis isn't the w to structure things, and I'm certainly open to that. Perhaps I should have multiple repos, with the rails skeleton repo tracking the master ccccccccccskeleton repo? And any individual pgggggggggggroject cloning the rails skeleton repo.
